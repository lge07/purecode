# The Purecode Text Editor
## Goals
- Extensibility
- Simplicity
- Efficiency

## Structuring
- Command system
  - A few commands that do simple things to a specific body of text
    - Search
    - Modify
    - Delete
    - Insert
    - External Run
    - External Getw
  - Abstractions with those commands that allow for greater functionality
  - Hook system that interprets keystrokes or command menu inputs and utilises the abstractions


## Feature Ideas
- Clipboard Interaction Environment
- Custom internal-external scripts
